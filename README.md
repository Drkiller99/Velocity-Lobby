# Velocity-Lobby
This plugin was originally made on 2020/05/19 but I had a lot of other private projects I was working on, I've recently just discovered it again as making a minecraft server for a few of my friends and wanted a fallback server. I figured why not update to the latest API and upload it. 
# Please note that in the config the "lobby-name:" is the name of your proxy servers lobby.
# Commands are currently: /hub, /lobby, /logout however you can change that in the source code as long as you follow the lisencing.

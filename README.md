# Velocity-Lobby
This plugin was originally made on 2020/05/19 but I had a lot of other private projects I was working on, I've recently just discovered it again as making a Minecraft server for a few of my friends and wanted a fallback server. I figured why not update to the latest API and upload it. I hope everyone enjoys it and I will be releasing some projects that I've been working on for a while in the future. I may work with velocity API in the future if plugins are requested enough.

# Configuration

The config is pretty basic as it was my first time working with their API, it's a simple one-liner that you need to input your fallback servers name. It is set by default as "lobby".

# Commands
The current commands are listed below and they all direct you to the specified lobby defined in your config.toml.
/hub | /lobby | /logout 

You can also use the command /server <name> by default now without downloading this plugin.

# TO-DO:
I'm not sure there's anything I need to do to this plugin apart from possibly add language support in the configuration for users that may not understand English. I will look at doing this in the future. If you would like to change the message that is sent when the user, please refer to line 44 in the LobbyCommand.java and change the message there. And possibly add comments to the project, however, I believe it's self-explanatory anyway.
